## Topic
- Detecting Heart Disease using Machine Learning Classification Techniques

## Overall Plan
Since cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally, early prevention could help in extending one’s life span and possibly quality of life. Since there are cases where patients do not show any signs of cardiovascular trouble until an event occurs, having an algorithm predict from their medical history would help in picking up on early warning signs a physician may overlook. Or could also reveal additional risk factors and patterns for research on prevention and treatment.

It has been decided for this project to take a high-level overview of the common, widely available classification algorithms and analyze their effectiveness for this specific use case. Notable ones include, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines.

Additionally, a variety of data sets that contain common information types will be used to increase the training and test pool for evaluation. As it is known that a large set of data is required to reduce the possibility of the algorithm’s overfitting.

**Datasets being considered:**

The range of creation dates vary from as late as 2 years to as recent of 4 months. This does bring up a small hiccup in preprocessing to consider. Namely the possibility of changing diet and culture trends resulting in significantly different trends/patterns within the same age group. 

This possible phenomenon may be of interest to explore closely if time allows. Whether a trend itself is even present or there is an overarching trend across different cultures and time periods. Or to consider if this difference is significant enough that the data from the various sets needs to be adjusted to normalize the ages to present day.

## What needs to be done to achieve a great grade
1.	A report analyzing the results and outlining the procedure of the project.
2.	The report satisfies the minimum length requirement and complies with the additional requirements outlined in the project pdf
3.	Searching and curating a large data set on heart disease
4.	A software component that preprocesses and trains various machine learning algorithms on the chosen dataset
5.	The trained algorithms are tuned to a reasonable degree to obtain the maximum performance possible within the project timeframe

### Strech goals for the project
1.	Further analysis of the datasets to see if the age between the creation/release date reveal any shifts over time
2.	What occurs when the data set is normalized based on creation/release date to the newest set and if they reveal any other interesting trends
